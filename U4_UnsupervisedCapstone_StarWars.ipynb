    "\n",
    "For my Unsupervised Learning Capstone, I wanted to think about a practical and fun way to understand unsupervised learning and natural language processing. Practically you can think about ways to implement this - text websites, reviews, customer surveys, etc. But in a fun way I thought about movie scripts - what if you got a movie script that you knew of and drew out natural language techniques to pick apart significant words that associated the dialogue with key characters? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this vein I looked at the script to one of my favorite movie franchies, Star Wars IV - a classic, good feel movie with one of the best protagonists in movie history. I took the text file of the script, ran it through a data frame, leveraged a tf-id vectorizing algorithm to see if the user could predict between characters - knowing their personalities and what their most significant words were - who said what."
